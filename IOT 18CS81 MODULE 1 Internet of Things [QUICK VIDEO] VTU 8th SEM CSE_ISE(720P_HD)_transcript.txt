hello everyone today in this video will be discussing the first module of iot and in this module we have a few set of question that's what I'll be doing in each of the subjects these are the set of questions which you need to know to score maximum marks in this subject restaurant you did not study much about that so let's discuss each of these questions one by one in the body will be over let's get started and so the first topic here we have is What is iot means there will be many things connected with each other that is called as iot if you enter your home and you have which can detect the temperature or you have the camera in which you can observe the surroundings based on that you can make some decisions and you can write some code to do something when something happens for example if you come to home and you want to start on and it should start eating the water by using iot internet of interconnection of things Genesis of iot that means what is the path of iot where it started and now where it is OK four things have to mention here the first is connectivity you remember in the 2000 when the internet started at that time people used to send emails to each other the used to talk with each other and that also included web browsing these two things were present that was in the first error second it got expanded to the industries where in the people started doing the business things and online selling and buying things that is The E-Commerce thing that happened and after that the social media came finally know people are connected all over the world by using some protocols and technologies and those things in which the data as well as the person's all both are connected and that found that is more important so iot means focus on connecting things on the Internet in internet the things are connected that is called as iot for example if you go to any Mall at that time they will be tracking you where you are present ok suppose this is the map of the mall and if you are present here what all things you are buying you will be most interesting in that right there only will become whatever your interested there will be tracking which place you're going and based on that there will be changing their surrounding things what based on that they can attract more customers that is the iot and making something digital camera was there and something will happen like processing of the holi images that is what is iodine digital it was like 6.307 billion devices now it has rise to 50% devices ok so there are four things where it has impacted self driving car you all know what is self driving car it will be sensitive to see all its surroundings and based on that will make decision how fast to go where to take turn into put break and what all to do connected factory what are the processing happening all the things will be connected and smart connected buildings means two or more buildings will be conducted the kitchen bathroom hall and the corridor and the lights which went to be on went to be of the optimal timings of animals get some disease will get to know the changes in the behaviour like more information internet technology and OT means operational technology and not sure but the thing is in both of these things this is dealing with the physical objects and this is dealing with the software things this is hardware this is software both hardware and software are developed parallelly and merging of both of these gives rise to iot because if you want to run some code you need a hardware device security privacy Big Data Analytics give an example and thousands of gigabytes per second that much data is getting generated just by one wing of a plane imagine the whole plane how much data is getting generated in terabytes or petabytes like that many flights are there in that much data is getting generated that is the big data and analytics data is to be handled by the iot interoperability if they are different operating system they have to be handled the iot what could be Road it should be operable in all of the system like that is also another comparing iot architecture important topic which is regarding the drivers behind the new network architecture what is driving the new architecture how it is like what are the things needed to change that we need to include in our code some more better security approach and for all of these challenges there is some better solution so I'm not going to details of this better solution just you can go through it just for your reference what it means drivers means what we have to change to make it more better than just that you have to remember then coming to comparing it three architecture the first one is the m2m architecture architecture there will be three categories here you will be having the application layer will be having all the application in the code written and here will be having the services layer which will be connecting all the application layers these things has come common service layer communication technology is communication network communication device and hardware all these things will be able to run record next we have the w o i o t w f iot means iot world forum in this 7 layers are there physical devices which are the physical hardware devices they are connected and we do the edge computing we get some data from a data is accumulated as a storage and the abstraction is done means the relevant data is on this one and then the application part is here and collaboration process means the final architecture to explain each of these things happen and management communication connecting those things with the actual data and Sensex means which actually Fetch the data support camera whatever you do that will be captured that is called as a sensor actuator means after sensing Something any action it is to be done for example active can be if you go for a wireless you come out of the washroom at that time in some companies it will be there right you put your hand like this and the hot air will come that is called for the three types of computing in cloud what we have is the data which is getting remote location can go through these things all of these things tell me shortage of time so make sure you know the concept of variable and for more information can go through here that's all for this video and thank you so much for watching
