back to another video in this video we will discuss some iot projects for beginners so let's get started a huge Shout Out to ultimate jlc PCB for sponsoring this video number 15 if you are always occupied with work or remain out of the house most of the time then there are chances you can forget to feed your fish but no more with this small fish feeder with this you can feed your fish from anywhere just for the top of your smartphone into the tank when any of the feeding option is selected time number 14 automatic fan speed controller whenever the temperature crosses the threshold value operating the speed increases with the increase in temperature the threshold temperature can be the ambient temperature and the fan speed can be viewed on the LCD as well as on the dashboard the dashboard is easy to set up you just need to create widget and assign a name any virtual pin number to them number 13 sometimes it becomes active to manually open and close your garage door but by making it smart you can make the process simple for this you will require esp8266 module it is placed at the ceiling of the garage can be controlled from your smartphone the magnetic sensors at each end of the door ensure its complete opening and closing some additional sensors are also soldered to the PCB that can be used to detect the temperature humidity and unnecessary motion in the garage does giving additional security to your house number 12 are you also concerned about the water quality you are drinking it measures the total dissolved salts in the water temperature and this place is readings on an oled display and if you're not at home you can still check the readings any time on the dashboard the readings are shown in the form of crops for an easy representation and if it is also increase be on the permissible limit you can take the necessary actions on time and always keep your loved one safe Number 11 Smart home is one of the important applications of iot and before making your home smart check the simple project where you can control the status of electrical load using a smartphone you will need to create a thing on the iot cloud and put the devices as the variables after setting up the device a device ID and secret key will be generated create a web layout on the dashboard diagram Number 10 in your home or office if you are bored or manually offering a switch simple solution that will make things easy for you using the smart socket you just need your smartphone to control a particular AC load inside the socket lies a circuit that contains an esp8266 a relay some transistors and resistors you just need to insert the smart socket over the electric board and keep the switch open Connect using your smartphone all types of PCB services and assembly at very competitive prices their high quality pcbs accompanied by a quick delivery and great customer service make them the perfect partner for your electronics projects check out the link in the description below to find out more about altium designer and jlc PCB number 9 various devices that we used to be operated using batteries their improper user storage may lead to explosions so it becomes important to monitor the status of batteries to keep the device working with this very monitoring system the voltage level and charging discharging status of your battery look pretty simple but it will get the job done for this project can be modified and large scale the monitor the battery status of cars or remotely located battery banks on your smartphone which features is that it can act as an SOS device by just pressing a button the current location of the tracker can be sent to a Smartphone and it can make even a call to a particular number the location can also be obtained by sending an SMS to the device using your phone a container rechargeable battery that can be charged either using a micro USB type C cable there is a huge probability that you might have seen this watch are you still have one to bring back to memories this project will teach you how you can recreate this Clock on different displays the USB 32 features the current date and time for the internet and shows it on a display the display contains an image of the clock at the background to show the details you will have to make the same size font and with a simple code you are ready to view the date and time on the display among all these displays which one will you prefer to use number 5 rooms with no proper ventilation the carbon dioxide concentration may build up very quickly I CO2 concentration may have serious issues on our health that's why it becomes important regularly check the air quality and with this project you can also measure the temperature and humidity along with the Co2 levels please readings can be viewed on an oled display or on the dashboard the dashboard allows you to view the instantaneous values as well as the time based trend number 4 with this project you can monitor the Bitcoin price any time having a price sticker at your desk has many benefits in the display you can see the current Bitcoin price the last updated time the change in price and a graph to easily view the change over a period for this you just need to copy the API place it in a code in uploaded to the board and your Bitcoin ticker is ready to display the data thermometer to measure our body temperature with this project will learn to build that shows real time data only web page the web page allows you to control the devices on of statistics you will learn a lot by following tsp module in the thermometer remains in the deep sleep mode most of the time which says power and improves the battery life number 2 our next project is a simple setup to control the server movement over the Internet this can come in handy in various advanced applications for this you need to install a custom image the Raspberry Pi and create a game on the dashboard the camera remote user to view the current position of the Servo Motor and with the keyboard control movement as well as the turning speed can be changed as the user disconnect the server returns to the home position number one if you are found of reading and collecting books then sometimes it becomes difficult to keep a track of every book you have anyone there may be a point when you don't know whether you already have this you can use this project you just need to enter the ISBN number of a particular book and it will check whether you have this book or not and with that you can pretty easily solve the collection of books or any other thing that you are interested in collecting so these are some of the iot projects that you can try if you are a beginner drop a like and subscribe to our channel to keep supporting us will see you again good bye
